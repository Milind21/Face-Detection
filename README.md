# Face-Detection
Face/Eye/Smile Detection using OpenCV

A jupyter notebook and a python script is uploaded to detect faces in a image.
This incorporates OpenCV library and an algorithm known as Harr Cascade Algorithm.
This link "http://www.willberger.org/cascade-haar-explained/" contains the necessary information about the algorithm.
Adaboosting is used for the cascading process in the library.
Harr features are downloaded from the github repository of OpenCV and are in XML format.
By using different xmls or combining few xml multiple attributes can be detected.
